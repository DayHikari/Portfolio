# My Personal Portfolio
A project to host my portfolio including links to my other projects.

## URL
https://david-masons-portfolio.vercel.app/

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript
- Next.JS
- TailwindCSS

## Learnings
- This project was developed along side my School of Code final project and was a great way to learn new techniques that could be applied to both projects such as the light/dark mode.
- The difference between this project and the SoC final project is that this Portfolio was developed using TypeScript rather than JavaScript as I had had limited experience with TypeScript until that point. 
- This project really helped me become more comfortable with using Next.JS as well as structuring a website.
- TailwindCSS is very convenient and really helped with the layout and styling of the Portfolio and as such is a package I will continue to use in the future.
